- "Open source" airship city. There is a very strict planning-culture and constantly shifting infrastructure. When docking to the city, you have to add your ship to the cities map for however many days you want to stay. People then can reserve space for their own affairs on each ship. There's another city below this one, where there are multiple airships of varying sizes parked on the ground in case of need for management purposes. (for example if more docking space is required because the available space isn't occupiable for long enough for a new ship, or smaller "lift" ships if someone has important affairs in the city, or bigger ones with schedules for visitors).
- Ancient tribe of [[Magier|magicians]], who keep their ability very secret and are actually quite familiar with [[Dämonen|demons]]. They don't meddle with the world. [[König Reym Corvus I|Corvus]] knows of them, but hasn't yet managed to attack them due to their sheer combined strength.
