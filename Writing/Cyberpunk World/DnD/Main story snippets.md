### Start
- Starts on inventors'-competition / convention (5 year anniversary of the Velbit / apokrylogical revolution)
- [[Eri]] wins, shakes hands with important person (Maybe even a [[Magier|magician]] or [[KÃ¶nig Reym Corvus|king Corvus]], who attends because of this rare occasion), then accidentally kills them.
- [[Gale]] and [[Gwen]] were out to kill that person too, but were too slow.
- [[Rudmaeus]] is there too, as participant.
- District is in complete lockdown because of the murder.
- Players have to flee. Gale and Gwen are interested in Eri out of curiosity (hopefully), Rudmaeus follows Gale and [[Melvis]] is with Eri already
