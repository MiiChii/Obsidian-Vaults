Hello,
This is a letter to whomever it may interest. I don’t know why but I felt like writing about my life cause it sounded fun to do so and I have quiet some time now between all the thief businesses that I have.
As I told you above I’m a small thief but I don’t work alone. But let me start with my sad backstory first.
You should know that I wasn’t a thief from the beginning of my life. I had beautiful parents and we lived in a small house in the city [[Veridian]]. My parents were inventors and they were able to work with a substance called “[[Velaris]]”. I was still a small chick when the knights of the (still living, I don’t know how old he is but it’s astonishing that he still hasn’t perished yet) king. I didn’t understand why they were taken away. They got too deep in the whole Velaris bizz and the king heard from it. I’m not sure what they did though besides some illegal things (if what I heard was true). Anyways the reason why I’m not detained or dead is that my parents hid me before the knights arrived at our home. The only thing I received from them was `~(redacted)`. Since then I’ve been an orphan but with the little bit of knowledge of the stuff I’ve learned from my parents (and what I remembered), also what I teached myself throughout the years from the discoveries of them and also their written documents.
Anyways, I lost my home and I had to live on the streets. I met some people who showed me how to survive on the streets and I honed my skills to be a master thief. I’ve started to steal important objects connected to Velaris because of its prize. It’s a little bit dangerous cause it’s still a rare resource and only permitted inventors/researchers are allowed to handle it and work with it. I got my informants but I still didn’t trust anyone.
