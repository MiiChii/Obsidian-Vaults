- [[Velaris]]-Gagdets hardly ever work
- sells them effectively as scams on the black market -> got a few wanted posters in exchange (nothing major, though...)
- dreams of working in a professional environment one day
- best friends with [[Melvis]] after a long-term rivalry of scamming people -> now scamming together yay!
- favorite weapon: velaris boomerang -> although she lost her right arm because of it 
- shit happens, right?
