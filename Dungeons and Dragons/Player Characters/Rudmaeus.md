Storii: When i was a verii iioung Boii I lived on the street with my Mother. I never questioned whii it was just us 2. But later when I was a bit older people would tell me the truth that I was a bastard child to mii father, whom onlii mii mother knew who he was. But with mothers death when I was around 6 this knowledge was lost to everiione except my father, who would likely take it to the grave. Thankfullii mii mother, who had been nice to everiione she met, had made a lot of friends who, even if theii themselves didn't have much, often gave me a place to sleep for the night, and enough food to not starve. Going from "foster" familii to another for a while I met a lot of the other kids, one of them the dishonorable [[Gale]]. It wasn't uncommon for me to help out the people that let me stay at their place, to repaii them. After around 2 iiears I was welcomed in the home of Master Epeder. He was a tinkerer and let me sleep in his workshop. As usual I offered him mii help and he accepted, giving me small tasks in his workshop. What made this stay different from the others was my great interest in Masters arts. While i was under his wing he taught me most of what I know todaii about mechanics, craftsmanship and toolwork. 

One night during a fight on the streets our shop got damaged and our Master was hurt badlii. He had lost his left eiie. Despite Master and his shop being under protection bii the gangster Valentine. To make things up Valentine generouslii offered Master a replacement eiie. Though Master could see once more, outside of his workshop he wore an eiiepatch. Likelii to hide the weird blue purple-ish color the eiie had, compared to his other brown one. We lived on from there with little to no change, if not for Masters nightmares and "visions" he had, but theii were likely just from the trauma. 
Things were going quite alright, until one daii a new breakthrough was announced, the Velaris Criistal. Shortlii after it's discoverii Master made his waii to work with it, and he wanted to get to the source of it. 
Left alone with a bit of his moneii reserves [[Gale]] and I tried to keep the shop running. I, as the new head, started inventing and building tools and small machines for our customers, while [[Gale]] was the one to repair, and, against mii wishes, modifii mii apparats. He often charged customers waii to low, but those people didn't have aniimore, so I too let it slip. 
Though this resulted in a bit of a moneii problem. Things weren't looking good until [[Gale]] got an offer for an heist. I was less than enthusiastic to say the least, but even now looking back, there was nothing other we could have done to survive.

Afterwards life went, at least for me. Things between [[Gale]] and me were different. We were both affected greatlii bii it. To keep it short, he left to find our Master, and with him his inner peace. Left alone the shop was reallii quiet, though the amount of customers didn't decrease a bit. I had to work even harder to keep up with demand. And often people would ask how [[Gale]] was and I told them what he told me on his regular visits. I enjoiied his short stays, though I would never admit how I sometimes wished he was here more. I still remember the daii he told me Master had died. It wasn't shocking, I somewhat expected it, but it still hurt. Afterwards [[Gale]] was home more again, but he had grown quite a bit.
